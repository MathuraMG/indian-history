Compilation of data about indian history from 1600 - 1947

## So, what is this about?

This repository is a compilation of data that is related to the colonisation and freedom struggle of India. The data starts from early 17th century, when the British started trade with India through the East India Company and goes all the way through 1947, when India finally got Independence from the British. 
This is a compilation made mostly through self-research. On that note, you are most welcome to add/correct information that is present here as long as there are solid sources to corroborate the facts.

## Why does this exist?

When I was looking into making technical project about the history of India, I found it difficult to find data about the India struggle for independence in one place. This repository aims to be that data source.
